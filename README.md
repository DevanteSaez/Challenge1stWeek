README,

Following code is for the first assignment that was given to us in week one.

Just below is changes i made to the different codes which are HTML and CSS

Changes to HTML,
I did not do much to the HTML code only added a title and added my ALTS to the images there are already semantic syntaxs in the code that was given to us which was footer and i changed the head to header just to be specific.

Changes to CSS,
Moved most of the classes to follow the same structure of the HTML code since that would make the most sense.
